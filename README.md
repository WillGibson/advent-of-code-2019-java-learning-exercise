# Advent of Code 2019 - Java / Spring Boot

Seems I might be using Java and Spring Boot for work imminently, so I figured doing some [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019) might be a good exercise.

## Requirements

I used the following:
* OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.8+11)
* Spring Boot 2.3.4.RELEASE

## The exercises

Run `mvn spring-boot:run` in your terminal, the answers will be in the console output.

## The tests

Run `mvn test` in your terminal.
