# Advent of Code 2019 - Java / Spring Boot

Seems I might be using Java and Spring Boot for work imminently, so I figured doing some [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019) might be a good exercise.

## Requirements

I used the following:
* OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.8+11)
* Spring Boot 2.3.4.RELEASE

## The exercises

Run `mvn spring-boot:run` in your terminal the visit http://localhost:8080/?day=02 in your browser to see the answers.

## The tests

Run `mvn test` in your terminal.

N.B. This is not currently running the user acceptance tests, but they can be run from Intellij...
